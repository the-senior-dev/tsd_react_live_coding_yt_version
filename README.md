# React.js Live Coding Interview

### Starting Point:
1. A list of colors composed of "red" and "green" elements.
2. A "Square" component that renders a square of a given color and executes a click method.

### TODO'S:
Complete the implementation of App.js so that it:
1. Uses the given Square component to render all squares from the "colors" list
2. Exposes the following functionality:
// - click green => change current element to "red" + add 1 new "green" element at the end of the list
// - click red => delete current element
3. [Optional] Add a button to reset the list of colors to its initial state
4. [Optional] Render a history of user actions (clicks) in the App component
 - choose your own display to do so
5. Discuss the Performance and Scalability of your implementation
